            Double You was born out of a need to track and engage with children with chronic diseases. Data on kids with chronic diseases is a valuable input for future treatment. Unfortunately, this data is hard to collect because often kids arenâ€™t motivated and parents must take time out of their day to help facilitate record keeping.
